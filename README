# wfeditor

WFEditor allows one to run a workflow on a compute cluster by interacting with a visual interface on a personal computer.

## Requirements

WFEditor requires Java SE 6 or higher.  

The server process should be run in a typical POSIX environment (e.g., UNIX, Linux) with typical characteristics -- piping of streams, a set of standard command line tools, and an SSH server.

## Usage

The client can be run as
java -jar wfeditor-<arch>.jar
The server can be run just like the client, but with an extra -S flag
java -jar wfeditor-<arch>.jar -S

The Mac OS X client in GUI mode requires the extra flag -XstartOnFirstThread
java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar wfeditor-macosx.jar

The client can be run in a GUI mode or a command-line mode.  The full command-line options are given when the -h flag is given
java -jar wfeditor-macosx.jar -h
